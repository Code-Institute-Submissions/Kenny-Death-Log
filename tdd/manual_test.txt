III. CHARTS

a) Does the Line Chart display the data correctly?
   - Mostly/Partial Pass
     - Note: Dc.js Line Charts are not supposed to display null values as zero on the chart, even though
       Javascript interprets Null as zero. It does display them as zero on things such as Bar and Row Charts,
       but Line Charts are the exception by design. A workaround is extremely difficult, but was attempted extensively
       to no avail. Records with zero as an entry that are surrounded by entries with a positive value are simply
       crossed over by the chart, as is evident with Season 10 on the X-Axis of the Line Chart on this site. A row chart
       could have been used, but I really wanted to incorporate a line chart, as it looks aesthetically better.

b) Do the other charts display their relevant data records correctly on page load?
   - Yes/Pass

c) Do the charts utilise Crossfilter correctly to update when a certain selection is made on any one chart?

d) Do the charts experience any errors when selections are made, or selections unmade again?
   - No/Pass

e) Does the 'Total Deaths' box update with the total according to the charts or selections made?
   - Yes/Pass

f) Does the selection box work correctly so that any death type can be chosen and displayed on the charts?
   - Yes/Pass

g) Does the tour button initialise the tour and without error?
   - Yes/Pass

h) Does the tour work as expected, with the 'Next' and 'Previous' buttons functioning as they should?
   - Yes/Pass

i) Does the tour explanation pop-up appear off-screen for any of the charts?
   - No/Pass

j) Do the charts adapt to fit the current screen size?
   - Yes/Pass
